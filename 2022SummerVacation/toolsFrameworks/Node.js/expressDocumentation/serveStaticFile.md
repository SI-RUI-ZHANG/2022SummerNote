# Serving static Files in Express

To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and Javascript files, use the `express.static` built-in middleware function in Express.

Function signature

```javascript
express.static(root, [options])
```

> This is a build-in middleware function in Express. It serves static files and is based on serve-static

- `root`: specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets.
- `options`: [see official documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router)

Use the following code to serve image, CSS files, and JavaScript files in directory named `public`:

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

You can call the `express.static` middleware function multiple times

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use(express.static('files'));
```

> Express will looks up the files in the order in which you set the static directories with the `express.static` middleware function

To create a virtual path prefix for files that are served by the `express.static` function, specify a mount path for the static directory

```javascript
app.use('/static', express.static('public'));
```

The path that you provide to the `express.static` function is relative to the directory from where you launch your node process. If you run the express app from another directory, itâ€™s safer to use the absolute path of the directory that you want to serve:

```javascript
const path = require('path')
app.use('/static', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))
```
